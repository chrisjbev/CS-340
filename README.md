Grazioso Salvare Dashboard Project

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I focus on clear structure, consistent naming, and separating different responsibilities into modules. In Project One, I created a Python CRUD module that handled all database interactions separately from the dashboard interface. This made the code easier to understand and maintain because the database logic was isolated from the user interface logic.
The main advantage of working this way was that changes to the database structure or queries could be made in one place without breaking the rest of the program. It also reduced code duplication and made debugging easier. In the future, this CRUD module could be reused for other dashboards or applications that require MongoDB access, such as inventory systems, customer databases, or data analysis tools. By keeping database operations modular, the program becomes more adaptable to future requirements or different projects.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I begin by analyzing the requirements and breaking the problem into smaller, manageable parts. For this project, I focused first on understanding what data Grazioso Salvare needed from the database and how they wanted to visualize it. I then built the database queries and tested them before connecting them to the dashboard components.
This approach differed from earlier assignments because it required integrating multiple technologies—MongoDB, Python, and dashboard widgets—into one working system. Instead of solving isolated problems, I had to think about how all parts of the system interacted. In the future, I would use this same strategy by designing the database schema based on client needs first, creating reusable query modules, and validating results before implementing the user interface. This method ensures the system is both efficient and tailored to client requirements.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, build, and improve systems that help people store, process, and understand information. Their work matters because well-designed software enables organizations to make better decisions and work more efficiently.
This project demonstrates how computer science supports real-world problem solving by providing Grazioso Salvare with a functional dashboard to filter and analyze rescue animal data. The dashboard allows the company to quickly locate animals suitable for different types of rescue missions instead of manually searching through records. By automating data access and visualization, this system helps reduce errors, save time, and improve operational effectiveness. Projects like this show how computer scientists contribute to business success by transforming raw data into useful, actionable information.
